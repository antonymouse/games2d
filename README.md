# games2d
An experiment designed to check if games can be build in Java using techniques and patterns typically used for enterprise develelopment. Another goal is to compare abstractions created in such process with regular gamedev abstractions. Output of the project will consist of 2- and 3D game platforms feature-limited but ready for customization.
