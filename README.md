# games2d
An experiment designed to check if games can be build in Java using techniques and patterns typically used for enterprise develelopment. Another goal is to compare abstractions created in such process with regular gamedev abstractions. Output of the project will consist of 2- and 3D game platforms feature-limited but ready for customization.
Currently the game is constrained in the following ways:
1. It's a tile-based game
2. The level map doesn't scroll
3. There is only 1 sprite (active character), no NPC
4. The choice of the default frame to show for the sprite is hard-coded
5. There is only 1 resolution.
